# Trivia Golden Master Kata

## Description:
This is a legacy code kata simulates that implements the Trivia game.

The code is small but it has a lot of code smells and sometimes it's difficult to understand.
 
## Goals:
- Create a Golden Master piece to ensure the the Trivia game continues working as before.
- Optionally you can refactor the code helped with the Golden Master created previously.
