# Gilded Rose Golden master

## Description:
This kata has a legacy code to practice writing a Golden Master piece.

Write your code inside the gilded_rose/main.py

# Business requirements
You don't need the business requirements.

## Goals:
- Write a code to generate an output that you need to be sure the code behaviour does not change.
- Write an script to automate the test execution.

## Run the tests

    make 
    
or open [Makefile](./Makefile) and execute the one you want.
